# COLORS Lab - COP4331C, Processes for Object-Oriented Software Development (POOSD)
In this lab, we created a basic application that logs in a user and allows them to add colors to their profile.
The goal of the lab was not to create the application, but rather learn the workings of setting up a website
through a LAMP stack, buying its domain, and connecting to the droplet using ssh. The code for the application
was provided.

## Technologies Used:
Digital Ocean was used to provide the LAMP stack droplet setup, while the domain name was bought through GoDaddy.

## Setup Instructions:
How to perform this project can be found in 'Getting Started with Lamp.docx'.

## Running And Accessing the Application:
You can access the complete application at anthonymahon.xyz (as of Feb 15, 2026). If you a reading this some time after this
date, I do not guarantee that the application will be running there.

## AI Use:
I acknowledge that Gemini AI was used to help me set up this website, as this _was_ my rodeo. I used it primarily to learn how to
connect to my droplet through ssh and to do some minor debugging on the provided application code.

## Assumptions:
I assume that the reader has not attended the class lab sessions.
